    <h1>Github Forking Explained!</h1>

    <p>
        Forking in github is like copying a repository from somebody else and saving it to my own selection of repositories for me to edit freely without effecting the original.<br>
        I can clone this repository to my local machine like my own created repos, edit then commit back to github. There is an option to make a 'Pull Request' back to the original owner<br>
        if im trying to contribute to a project for example but this isnt a beginner's feature at the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
        When in the repository on github, at the top right corner you will find a 'fork' option like in the image below circled in red.<br>
        Once forked it will ask you to name the fork and give it a description like when creating a new repo. The only thing to do after creating the fork is to clone it to local device.

    <h1>Introduction to HTML</h1>
    <p>
        HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) defines the structure of a web page and were its contents is placed. It is used to create the paragraphs, headings, lists,<br>
        images and links which is usually displayed on a typical webpage.

    <h2>Elements and Tags</h2>
    <p>
        Almost all the elements on a page e.g a paragraph is just content wrapped in HTML opening and closing tags. Basically a tag defines when an element starts or ends using<br>
        keywords wrapped in angled brackets. The Opening tag for a paragraph looks like <img src="./Snippets/Opening_Paragraph_Tag.png" alt="Opening tag">.<br>
        Closing tags are the same but have a forward slash after the first angle bracket to indicate its a closure. These are used so the browser knows when to end an element.

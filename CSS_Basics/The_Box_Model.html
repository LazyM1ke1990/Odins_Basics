    <h1>CSS: The Box Model</h1>
    <p>
        The box model is the first most important step to being successful in CSS. Everything on the web page is a box. You can have boxes inside a box or side by side each other.<br>
        These boxes can be roughly understood by using the 'Outline' Property on all elements (Using the Universal selector). The boxes wont be visible unless you give a border, border thickness and border color value.

    <p>
        The size, shape and space around them can be manipulated in many different ways using 'Padding','Margin' and 'Borders'
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Padding: Is the empty space between the border of the box and the contents of the box. This space can be manipulated to give more or less empty space between the box contents and box border</li>
        <li>Margin: Is the space outside of the box border and between the adjacent boxes border. This increases or decreases distance between the 2 boxes.</li>
        <li>Border: Is the space between the margin and the padding. Its what creates the border effect around a box. It can be as little as a pixel thick(Very thin)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Standard/Alternative box Model</h2>

    <p>
        The box model consists of a standard Variant model and an Alternative variant. These variants use the same Content,Margin,Padding,Border box measurements but style them differently when visible in the browser.<br>
        Using the below dimesions as an example we can workout the actual sizes of each box which is done in the below sub headings.
    </p>
    <img style="margin-left:20px" src="./Snippets/Standard_Box_Dimensions.png" alt="Image of box dimension">
    <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Standard</strong> - If you set a height and width property of an element in a standard box variant (Which is the browsers default) these values will define the <em>contents</em> box dimensions only, disregarding the padding,border and margin.<br>
            <img src="./Snippets/Standard_Box.png" alt="Standard box model">
            <br>
            The actual space taken up by this standard variant box is <em>410px</em> wide and  <em>210px high</em> this is because the content box width is 350px plus 25px of padding either side of the content, then 5px border either side of the padding<br>
            (350 + 25 + 25 + 5 + 5= 410). Same thing for the height (150 + 25 + 25 + 5 + 5= 210).
        </li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>
            <strong>Alternative</strong> - If you set the height and width property in an alternative box variant (Which needs to be defined using <sub><img src="./Snippets/Box_Sizing_BorderBox.png" alt="box-sizing: border-box example"></sub> within CSS styling) Then the total box dimesions will stay as<br>
            the height and width values that were defined including the padding and border values. This is a benefit as you do not need to calculate the dimesions manually. They are what you set them as.

    <h3>*Pro Tip*(Inheriting Box Sizing)</h3>
    <p>
        Most developers would set the 'box-sizing: border-box' property to all elements from the start of the project to make things easier. This is done in the HTML element itself like the example below.<br>
        Just doing this doesn't usually pose an issue but you may come accross problems were you want to reset an element to a 'Content-Box' which is fine. The issue poses when you have a child element inside<br>
        of this content box which you want to also follow into a 'Content-Box' but it doesnt do what your expecting. This element stays as a 'Border-Box'! To solve this issue you can declare from the begining code<br>
        with a universal selector ('*') to inherit parents 'box-sizing' option.

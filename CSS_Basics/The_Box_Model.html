    <h1>CSS: The Box Model</h1>
    <p>
        The box model is the first most important step to being successful in CSS. Everything on the web page is a box. You can have boxes inside a box or side by side each other.<br>
        These boxes can be roughly understood by using the 'Outline' Property on all elements (Using the Universal selector). The boxes wont be visible unless you give a border, border thickness and border color value.

    <p>
        The size, shape and space around them can be manipulated in many different ways using 'Padding','Margin' and 'Borders'
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Padding: Is the empty space between the border of the box and the contents of the box. This space can be manipulated to give more or less empty space between the box contents and box border</li>
        <li>Margin: Is the space outside of the box border and between the adjacent boxes border. This increases or decreases distance between the 2 boxes.</li>
        <li>Border: Is the space between the margin and the padding. Its what creates the border effect around a box. It can be as little as a pixel thick(Very thin)</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Block and Inline Elements</h1>
    <p>
        CSS has 2 main box types, 'Block' and 'Inline' Boxes. There is a middle variant called 'Inline-Block' but if using this then you would usually start thinking about using 'Flexbox' Instead.<br>
        Flexbox is a flexible box layout model which will be learned indepth in the future. For now, back to Block and inline layouts.<br>
        The 'Display' property is what controls how HTML elements are layed out on the webpage.<br>
        Most elements are displayed as block elements as default (Display: block). This means each element will stack one on top of each other, each starting on a new line.<br>
        Inline elements do not start on a new line and appear next to each other. An example would be the links anchor element, if put in the middle of a sentence it will behave like it is<br>
        apart of the text. Adjusting the margin or padding could effect this in a troublesome way so not advised to with Inline Elements.

    <h2>Divs & Spans</h2>

    <p>
        'Divs and 'Spans' play a crucial role to the 'Block' and 'Inline' Formats. Unlike all other elements (like a paragraph element) which give clear meaning to their context (This is going to be a paragraph written here)<br>
        Divs and spans are just empty generic boxes which could contain ANYTHING inside of them. The 'Div' is a block level empty box and the 'Span' is an inline level empty box.<br>
        At first these may seem useless but they are actually really helpful in 'Hooking' elements. We can give an 'ID' or 'Class' and use these to Style with CSS or to group multiple elements<br>
        together and use this grouping to position them on a page under one parent element.
